FBPDF
=====

Fbpdf is a framebuffer pdf and djvu viewer.  There are three make
targets: fbpdf uses mupdf library for rendering pdf, fbpdf2 uses
poppler for the same purpose, and fbdjvu uses djvulibre library for
rendering djvu files.  The following options are available in all
three programs:

  fbpdf [-r rotation] [-z zoom_x10] [-p page_number] file.pdf

The following table lists the commands available in fbpdf.  Most of
them accept a numerical prefix.  For instance, '^F' tells fbpdf to
show the next page while '5^F' tells it to show the fifth next page.
